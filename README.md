# Game Info
I implemented a one level game that has collapse/blast mechanics. The game was developed using Unity. There are 4 different colored cubes (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). The board is 6x6. The A condition is 4, B condition is 6, and C condition is 9(The condition size is excluded). The level never ends since a end condition was never specified by the company. Matching condition is if two adjacent cubes are the same color. You can play by tapping any matched cubes. It will calculate your score based on the number of cubes you have destroyed. I have used different 3rd party assets for aesthetic purposes.
